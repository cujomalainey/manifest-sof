# What is this repo?
This is an alternative manifest for the ChromeOS repo tool. This swaps out
dependency repos required to support the Sound Open Firmware.

# Repo Groups
Repo is the tool that we use to manage our local checkouts. It parses the
manifest specified by the `default.xml` file. The name of the manifest can be
ovverriden using `-m`. One could also check out a subset of the manifest using
the repo `groups` feature. This section documents the important groups that are
part of the default chromiumos manifest.

## minilayout
This group is the minimum subset of repos needed to do a full build of Chrome
OS. It doesn't include all of the repos to necessarily test the OS image but
does include all those needed to create an iamge.

## buildtools
The subset of repos needed to perform release actions i.e. payload generation,
etc. Used by release engineers, TPMs, and Infra team members. Note this group
isn't useful without a checkout of manifest-internal.

## labtools
Tools needed to perform routine lab administrative actions like DUT
re-allocation or lab server management.
